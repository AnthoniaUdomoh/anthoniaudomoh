# Anthonia Udomoh (@anthoniaudomoh)
I am a data analyst. My interest at the moment cuts across business analytics.

## Fun Fact
âœ¨âœ¨ I am also an entrepreneur that foster client continuity for business using Corporate Gifting<br>

<!-- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Cheta](https://cheta.com.ng)<br>
Cheta is a project born out of my classroom experience. After leaving the classroom, I was still a home lesson teacher for a while. It was then that I realised how difficult it is to help kids practice for common entrance examinations (NCEE). This is me trying to build something for myself using my knowledge of WordPress.<br>

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Stopeet! A search platform to help detect fake job locations.

## My values

âœ… A fan of checklists (and step-by-step)<br>
